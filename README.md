# AI-Virtual-Mouse

This Python script demonstrates an AI virtual mouse system using computer vision techniques. It allows users to control the mouse cursor on their computer screen using hand gestures captured via webcam.

Features:

Hand Detection: Utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand detection and tracking.
Gesture Recognition: Recognizes hand gestures for left-clicking, right-clicking, and scrolling based on the size and position of the detected hand.
Mouse Control: PyAutoGUI library is used to move the mouse cursor and perform click and scroll actions corresponding to detected gestures.
Simple Implementation: The script provides a basic yet effective implementation of an AI virtual mouse, suitable for educational purposes and experimentation.
Usage:

Ensure Python and the required libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, PyAutoGUI) are installed.
Run the script on your local machine with a connected webcam.
Perform hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the mouse cursor.
Notes:

Adjustments to gesture recognition thresholds may be necessary based on environmental conditions and hand sizes.
This project serves as a starting point for exploring computer vision-based human-computer interaction techniques.
Feel free to experiment and extend the functionality of the script to suit your needs!
